**OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT :-**

_Project:_ Network Security Analysis Tool

_Objective:_ Create a tool that analyzes network security by identifying open ports and outdated software versions.

_Functionalities:_

1. _Open Port Scanning:_ Utilizes nmap to scan open ports on a specified target.
    - The `scan_open_ports` function takes a target and port range as input and returns a list of open ports.
2. _Outdated Software Detection:_ Utilizes BeautifulSoup and requests to analyze a web page and detect outdated software versions.
    - The `check_outdated_software` function takes a URL as input and returns a list of outdated software.

_Dependencies:_

- nmap: for scanning open ports
- requests: for making HTTP requests
- BeautifulSoup: for parsing HTML and detecting outdated software

_Summary:_

This project creates a network security analysis tool that helps identify vulnerabilities in a network. The tool scans open ports using nmap and detects outdated software versions by analyzing web pages. This enables network administrators to take measures to improve their network's security.
